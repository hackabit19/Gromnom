> A food pooling app bringing foodies together.

## Idea
We will create meal combinations out of the food items from food ordering apps like Swiggy and Zomato which minimizes the total cart price considering the offers available in real-time. The order can be hosted publically or privately (and shared via a link) in the "HOST" section of the app, from where other users can opt to claim the remaining items. Once they claim one (or more) item(s) in any hosted meal combo they are added to a group chat including all the people who are a part of that order till it is delivered. 

## Working
Suppose a person A wants to order a pizza from a particular outlet which gives a maximum discount while ordering 3 pizzas. So he "hosts" a meal consisting of 3 pizzas (with two pizzas left unclaimed) on Gromnom (the app) and schedules the checkout at a particular time, say 2 PM. Now, some person B opens the app to see all hosted meals and finds the one created by A. Then, B claims the remaining two pizzas and makes a payment through the app. A gets a notification when all the items on his order have been claimed and are ready for checkout. A and B will meet at the delivery location, take their orders and B will mark the order delivered on Gromnom resulting in the staged payment being sent out to A.
